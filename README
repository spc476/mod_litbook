What is mod_litbook?
--------------------

  mod_litbook is an experiment in web technology, namely, the referencing
and displaying of hiarchial information using a notation commonly used to
refer to such information.  In the case of the Bible, this is generally the
``Book chapter:verse'' notation.

  I've been following several initiatives for some time, namely Project
Xanadu (http://www.xanadu.com/), Project Zope (http://www.zope.org) and the
web usability guide by Jakob Nielson (http://www.useit.com/alertbox/) and
the idea of being able to specify a document, or select portions of a
document, as part of the URL seemed like an interesting project to work on.

  I decided to use the Bible as a proof-of-concept since I could get an
electronic copy of the King James Bible from Project Gutenberg
(http://www.promo.net/pg/) and it's one of the most well known hiarchially
structured documents in existance.  And none of the other online bibles
allowed one to easily (as part of the URL) retrieve a select portion of it. 
Sure, you could get an entire book, or one chapter or a select verse, but
what about a mixture (such as Genesis 6:9-9:17, the Flood Story)?  

What mod_litbook is not:
------------------------

  And that's generic enough to be used for any project.  A project that can
be referenced as ``Book chapter:verse'' yes.  But currently, not much else. 
But the experiment is still going on and I do have plans on making
mod_litbook more generic in nature, or have a way to extend the
functionality.

Why is the King James Bible missing from your distribution?
-----------------------------------------------------------

  Because I didn't feel right in redistributing the copy I downloaded from
Project Gutenberg.  Also, the final format used for mod_litbook is fairly
tied to the architecture of the system currently serving it up (technically,
a 32-bit little-endian byte addressible system using ASCII).  Oh, that, and
that it would probably add an additional five megs to the distribution and
that's something I didn't want to add.

  I do, however, include the program I used to create the datafiles used by
mod_litbook, although it's specific to the Project Gutenberg distribution of
the King James Bible.
