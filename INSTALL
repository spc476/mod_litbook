* Installing the King James Bible.
*
*********************************************************************


[ ] 1. Retreive a copy of the King James Bible.

	You will need to retrieve a copy of the King James Bible from
	Project Gutenberg (http:// ...  ) and download a copy.  The reason
	I'm not providing a copy of it myself is that Project Gutenberg
	needs the publicity.  Also, mod_litbook can be used with other
	similiarly structured documents, such as the Book of Mormom or the
	Bible in another language.

[ ] 2. Convert King James Bible to native text format.

	First step is to ensure that the text file is in the native text
	format for your platform.  Under UNIX, this means each line has to
	end with a single linefeed (LF, character 10).  If you are under
	UNIX, this can be easily accomplished by running the following
	command (assuming that the file in question is called
	``bible.txt''):

	tr -d '\015' <bible.txt >bible.work

[ ] 3. Convert all tab characters to spaces.

	You now need to change all the tab characters (ASCII character 9) to
	spaces (ASCII character 32).  Under UNIX this can be easily
	accomplised by running the following command (assuming that the file
	in question is called ``bible.work''):

	tr '\011' ' ' <bible.work >bible.w2

	If you system is something other than UNIX, consult the
	documentation or a local expert if you do not know how to accomplish
	this.

[ ] 4. Edit the King James Bible.

 	You will then need to delete all the text up to the line that reads

		Book 01 Genesis

	And all the text after the last verse in the bible:

		022:021 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. 
		Amen.

[ ] 5. Build the program to create the data files.

	Change into the src directory and type `make breakout'.  This will
	create the breakout program which will use the edited Bible from
	Steps 2-4 to create the required data files.

[ ] 6. Create the location for the data files.

	Create a directory to contain the datafiles that will be created. 
	For example, on my system, I did:

	cd /usr/services/httpd/sites/bible.conman.org
	mkdir bible

[ ] 7. Create the datafiles.

	Change into the directory you just created and execute the following:

	/path/to/breakout < /path/to/edited_bible

	This program will create a directory per Bible book, and in each
	directory, two files per chapter.  The ones named ``XX.index''
	contain information about the number of verses per chapter and the
	location of each verse in the corresponding ``XX'' file (where XX is
	a number).

	For example, on my system, I did the following:

	cd /usr/services/httpd/sites/bible.conman.org/bible
	/home/spc/apps/mod_litbook-1.0.9/src/breakout < /tmp/bible.w2

	[ If you want to use another book, see the file DATA-FORMAT for
	information about the format required by mod_litbook.  You will be
	on your own in getting the book translated to the proper format.]

[ ] 8. Ensure the translation file exists.

	The translation file is a simple text file that maps Bible book
	names to their abbreviations.  I do provide a file for the King
	James Bible in the main mod_litbook directory called ``thebooks''. 
	[see the file DATA-FORMAT for more information on this file]

*******************************************************************
*
* Testing the King James Bible Data files
*
*******************************************************************

[ ] 1. Compile the test program.

	Change into the src directory and type `make testmod'.  This will
	compile an interactive test program.  There are some tests available
	via conditional compilation but you will have to manually enable
	those tests in the source code.

[ ] 2. Test the data files.

	Run the program `testmod /path/to/translationfile /path/to/books'. 
	Start requesting verses in the form of Book.chapter:verse.  If the
	datafiles are correctly built you will see the requested verse(s)
	come up on the screen.

	NOTE:  there is no prompt when running the program.  To end the
	program you will need to terminate it, typically with ^C (or ^D
	under UNIX).

*******************************************************************
*
* Installing the mod_litbook module into Apache.
*
*******************************************************************

[ ] 1.  Compile mod_litbook.

	Run 'make'.  If it fails, you may need to locate the 'apxs' program
	and then run 'make APXS=/path/to/apxs'.  This will compile
	mod_litbook for use for Apache 2.4.

[ ] 2. Decide on the URL space.

	You'll need to decide upon the URL space within the website to serve
	up verses from.  While it would be nice if it could be from the root
	location of the webserver (`/') for technical reasons this version
	requires a location other than the root (I use `/kj/').

	Also note that the URL space can't overlap an existing directory in
	the web server (for technical reasons).  That means if you have the
	following as a DocumentRoot:

	/www/htdocs/

	And you create a directory below it:

	/www/htdocs/bible/

	You cannot use /bible/ as the URL space for this module.  It won't
	work.

[ ] 3.  Configure Apache to use mod_litbook.

	Locate an appropriate web location on your website.  In the Apache
	configuration for the site under the appriate host, add the
	following:

	<Location /url/path/bible>
		SetHandler		litbook-handler
		LitbookIndex		<url-to-main-index-page>
		LitbookDir		/file/path/to/data
		LitbookTranslation	/file/path/to/data/thebooks
		LitbookTitle		"The Title Of The Bible"
	</Location>

[ ] 4. Copy additional files to the root web directory.

	Under the 'misc/' directory you'll find two files---a sample
	robots.txt file (see <http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html> for more
	information on this file) and a sample CSS file that can be used to
	style the output.

[ ] 5. Start the webserver.

	And that should be it.  If it doesn't start up, check the error log
	to see what might be wrong.  It might be that you didn't specify the
	right location or forgot to specify a mod_litbook configuration (you
	do need to set a Location, LitbookDir, LitbookTranslation,
	LitbookIndex, LitbookTitle and SetHandler).  Or the data files you
	created aren't in the proper format.
